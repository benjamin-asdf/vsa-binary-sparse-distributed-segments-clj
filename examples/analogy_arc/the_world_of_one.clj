;; ---------
;; Ideas:
;;
;; - building on triangle world: Say there is a range of possible, simple "discoverable" worlds.
;; - hypothesis: Genes and neurons can build something like a triangle world, it is *discoverable* (whatever that is) in brain networks.
;; - hypothesis: Neuronal ensembles are the elementary data type of brain
;; - neuronal ensembles *are* objects and agents
;; - 'Robustness is objectness': An ensemble (attractor) that is stable acrross transformations is an implementation of object permanance.
;; - if ensembles have a 'recipie' - 'vehicle', structure, they are memes (note they replicate across time, not copy numbers)
;; - hypothesis: A memetic ensemble is an implementation of agentness. (random variation - selection - free floating rationals - up little cognition).
;; - My feel is that 'memes' as the basic datatype say how the base mechanism implements both objectness and agentness.
;; - 'Attractor' doesn't speak 'agent with cognitive light cone' (M. Levin) to me, so I prefer 'meme'.
;; - This also emphasizes that there must be some prestine information piece that survives (or reinstantiates).
;; - If the basic datatype is a trajectory in time (or action sequence), it kinda already also says how to count a little.
;;
;;
;;
;; A cognitive system is discovering possible worlds in it's own computational system. Somehow it composes known worlds (sources)
;; - maps of maps? (Bienenstock)
;; - hierachies of analogies?

;; -------------
;; 'A world' is basically what I call the physiscs system of an imaginary simulated world.
;; This is the same as the language and implementation of a simulated machine (interpreter).
;; Once the view is taken, the equivalence between 'physics of simulated world' and language + interpreter seems unavoidable.
;;
;; Triangle world is the example.
;; Chess is an example. It is a world with a physics.
;;
;; Hence, you can chose a level and call 'physics' an 'interpreter'.
;; I.e. particel physics (or however that works) is an interpreter for the language of fields, particles (however that works).
;; Juxtopose stuff in time and space ('geometry'?) (== syntax and grammer of a language) and there is an outcome.
;;
;; This language is what we call particle physics, the description of the language and interpreter is the same as the description of the physics,
;; is the same as the description of a simulated world implementing the physics.
;;
;; (this doesn't meant that we run on a simulation, it means that computation and physics are the same thing).
